#Zenwatch Kernel
---
**I haven't been able to update this project in a while, and I also no longer own a 1st gen Zenwatch, so development on this kernel will no longer be active.**

- Kernel sources for a slightly modified kernel for the 1st gen Asus Zenwatch (anthias)

- Changes from stock:
	- Default CPU governor: ondemand
	- Increased vibration intensity (which was reduced from previous Android Wear versions)

- For basic Linux kernel information, see README, and for GPLv2 license, see COPYING.
